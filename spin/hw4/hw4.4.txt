4. Can you use LTL to verify the following the properties for a state
   in a Kripke structure? Justify.

   (a) There exists no path where p holds until q.
       
       In CTL this is equivalent to:
         
       !E(p U q)   =    
       !E(p U q)   =    A(!(p U q))

       Which in LTL is just simply

       ! (p U q)




   (b) There exists a path where p holds in a state, which is followed
       by a state where q holds.

       In CTL this is equivalent to:
       
       EF(p && Xq)
       EF(p && Xq)  =  !AG(!(p && Xq))

       Which in LTL is 

       ! G( !(p && Xq) )
