H4.3

Thm: 
For any Kripke structure, a state satisfies the CTL formula AG(a ∨ b)
if it satisfies the LTL formula G(a) ∨ G(b), where a and b are atomic
propositions.

This is FALSE

Consider the following Kripke Structure


                      ,------.
       ~~~~~        ~~∨~~    |
   --> | a | ---->  | b | ---' 
       ~~~~~        ~~~~~ 

Here there is only one path: a -> b -> b -> ... -> b

In CTL AG(a ∨ b) is true because in every path every state satisfies
either a or b. However in LTL G(a) ∨ G(b) does not hold, because not
every state in every path satisfies G(a) and not every state in every
path satisfies G(b). The equivalent LTL spec would just be G(a ∨ b).
